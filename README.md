Alzundaz malloc contest (NOT READY YET)
=======================================

A small C coding challenge:

> Create an implementation of the basic memory management functions such as `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` and `free`

Criteria
--------

* Code style (should be easily understandable).
* Performance:
  * *Memory consumption*, the allocator shouldn't use too much space for its own function.
  * *Time consumption*, the allocator should be fast enough.

Repository structure
--------------------

* `include/` is reserved for exposed headers.
* `sources/` is for the private C sources and headers.
* `CMakeLists.txt` used to build the project.

Contestant information
----------------------

*Put something here*
